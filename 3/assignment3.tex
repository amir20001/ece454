	By induction. Where the hypothesis is: a connected graph with one node has no edges.
	
	When there are \(k\) nodes, we have there are \(k-1\) edges. Show that with \(k+1\) nodes, there are \(k\) edges. 

	We can say that a connected graph \(G\) has \(k+1\) nodes, and take one of the leaf nodes of the tree. We know that a leaf node can only have one edge. If we remove this leaf node and corresponding edge, \(G\) is still a tree. Thus, \(G\) now has \(k\) nodes, and \(k - 1\) edges.

	In effect, if one removes each node and the associated edge, then at the end there will only exist the root node without any other edges.

		\item There are two client processes operating, \(P_a\) and \(P_b\). \(P_a\) requests a read of file \(f\) at time 1.  \(P_b\) requests to write to file \(f\) at time 2. The UNIX notion of correctness states that the read will occur and return the last state of the file, before \(P_b\)'s changes take effect. However, if there is a large delay when processing such that the write of \(P_b\) takes effect before \(P_a\) but lasts longer than the read, then \(P_a\) will see the file as it was changed, while operating under the assumption that no such change is in effect.
